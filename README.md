# Brain Games
This project is a set of five console games:

- **Even game** – Definition of an even number  
- **Calc game** – Arithmetic expressions  
- **GCD game** – Finding the Greatest Common Divisor  
- **Progression game** – Search for missing number in a sequence of numbers  
- **Prime game** – Definition of a prime number  
  
## Game Features:
- **Levels of Difficulty** – Choose from three difficulty levels: Easy (default), Medium, and Hard. The difficulty affects the complexity of the questions.
- **Scoring System** – Earn points for correct answers. If you provide an incorrect answer, points will be subtracted. After blocks of answers, the game is considered completed.
- **Statistics** – View the statistics of the top players (best local total score).
- **Settings** – You can change the player’s name and select the difficulty level through the Settings menu. The default difficulty is Easy.

Each game asks a series of questions that need to be answered correctly. After three correct answers, the game is considered completed. Wrong answers will end the game and reduce the total score.
