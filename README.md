# Brain Games
This project is a set of five console games:

Even game - *Definition of an even number*  
Calc game - *Arithmetic expressions*  
GCD game - *Finding the Greatest Common Divisor*  
Progression game - *Search for missing number in a sequence of numbers*  
Prime game - *Definition of a prime number*
